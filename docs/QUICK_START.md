# Football Team Selector - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will help you get the Football Team Selector up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git (optional)

## Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
cd backend
python3 run_server.py
```

âœ… **Success**: You should see:
```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
INFO: Application startup complete.
```

## Step 2: Test the API

Open a new terminal and test the API:

```bash
# Test the root endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/"

# Expected response:
# {"message":"Football Team Selector API"}
```

## Step 3: Add Some Players

```bash
# Add a striker
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/players/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alex", "attributes": {"attacking": 9, "defending": 4, "goalkeeping": 2, "energy": 8}, "available": true}'

# Add a defender
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/players/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Ben", "attributes": {"attacking": 3, "defending": 9, "goalkeeping": 4, "energy": 7}, "available": true}'

# Add a midfielder
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/players/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Charlie", "attributes": {"attacking": 7, "defending": 7, "goalkeeping": 3, "energy": 9}, "available": true}'
```

## Step 4: View Your Players

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/players/" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Step 5: Create Balanced Teams

You need 10 players total. Add 7 more players first, then:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/teams/balance" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "players": [
      {"name": "Alex", "attributes": {"attacking": 9, "defending": 4, "goalkeeping": 2, "energy": 8}, "available": true},
      {"name": "Ben", "attributes": {"attacking": 3, "defending": 9, "goalkeeping": 4, "energy": 7}, "available": true},
      {"name": "Charlie", "attributes": {"attacking": 7, "defending": 7, "goalkeeping": 3, "energy": 9}, "available": true}
      // ... add 7 more players to reach 10 total
    ]
  }'
```

## Step 6: Record a Game

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/games/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2024-01-20",
    "red_team": {"name": "Red", "players": [/* your red team players */]},
    "yellow_team": {"name": "Yellows", "players": [/* your yellow team players */]},
    "score": {"red_score": 3, "yellow_score": 2}
  }'
```

## Step 7: Check Player Stats

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/players/Alex/stats"
```
